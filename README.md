You can find the real life practice of basic apis and use of databases:

- Used languagues are NODE.JS. As a language for backedn.

- For Database MongoDB was chosen and instead of GUI or online platforms like Atlas.

 - And ODM called Mongoose was chosen. There are also considered Two-step authentication.
 first being usual email, password and second confirmation with unique code sent to email.

- As to looks, like the visual part of it. Handlebars.js (template engine) will help
me build dynamic HTML templates. And to make things more productive CSS framework
called Bootstrap will be used as well.
